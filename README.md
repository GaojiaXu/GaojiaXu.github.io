In `hw1.ipynb` file, there are 3 completed small examples from the [Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/archives), which are problem 6, 34 and 80.

In `hw2.ipynb` file, there are functions to find first 10-digit prime in the decimal expansion of 17Ï€. The question is separated into 3 functions and leverage them to write the main function to solve the problem.

In `hw3.ipynb` file, there are informative interactive visualizations about malaria with the [data sets] https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-11-13. with library plotly and ipywidgets.

In `hw4.py` file, there is a dashboard with 4 sections which leverage [Science and Engineering PhDs awarded in the US](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data). I use streamlit as the tool to create the dashboard visualization, because it is new and easy to implement.
